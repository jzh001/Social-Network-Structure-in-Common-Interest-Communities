Exploring social network structure of common-interest communities

This project aims to study the social network structure of a community of individuals who share common (music) interest by employing the techniques in Social Network Analysis. The project involves analysis of a dataset of more than 90,000 music reviews written over a period of 15 years by more than 9,000 users. The reviews, containing text and rating score given for each music release, serves as links between the users and the music releases, from which a social network of the users can be constructed based on the commonly reviewed releases. Using this network, (sub-)communities of users of common (music) interest can be identified and their evolution over time can be studied. Furthermore, formal concept analysis can also be applied to uncover groups of music releases that are closely related to one another, via the common-interest communities. These groups would also be compared with their music genres to discover the relationship among the genres.
